        <p class="p">We are stuck, stymied, frustrated. But it needn't be this way. There is a formula for success that's been followed
            by the icons of history - from John D. Rockefeller to Amelia Earhart to Ulysses S. Grant to Steve Jobs - a formula
            that let them turn obstacles into opportunities. Faced with impossible situations, they found the astounding
            triumphs we all seek. These men and women were not exceptionally brilliant, lucky, or gifted. Their success came
            from timeless philosophical principles laid down by a Roman emperor who struggled to articulate a method for
            excellence in any and all situations. This book reveals that formula for the first time - and shows us how we
            can turn our own adversity into advantage.</p>
